## Background changer in React

This simple React application demonstrates how to use the `useState` hook to dynamically change the background color of a container based on button clicks.

### Features:

- **Color State Management**: Uses `useState` hook to manage the current background color state.
- **Dynamic Button Clicks**: Each button triggers a state update to change the background color.
- **Styling**: Buttons are styled with different background colors and text colors.

### How It Works:

When you click on any of the colored buttons, the background color of the container changes to the corresponding color. This is achieved by updating the `color` state with the selected color from the button.

### Technologies Used:

- React
- useState Hook
- CSS (Tailwind CSS for styling)
